# CSCI-103-LAB-8-Binary-Search
Intro: In this lab you will use recursion to implement a binary search algorithm to find a
value in an array of data. 

What you will learn
After completing this lab you should be able:
- Implement a recursive function
- Understand the efficiency aspect of binary search vs. linear search
- Implement a 'selection' sort algorithm (maybe recursively)
